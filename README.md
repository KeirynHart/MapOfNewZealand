# Interactive Map Of New Zealand
This is an interactive map that I put together to provide an internal tool for market research in New Zealand as well as an interesting and interactive way to get an understanding of demographics within New Zealand at a very Granular Level.

This project required a number of moving parts in order to get everything working in the way it is now. I must note that the design elements aren't particularly amazing, but, the aim of this project was not to make it look perfect but instead to provide people within my company with a fast way to get accurate demographic data within New Zealand and to provide functionality where you can have the ability to drop a 1km radius circle anywhere in New Zealand and be provided with a relatively accurate idea of the dempgraphics contained within that circle.

# Where is the data from?
- The New Zealand Census
- QV House Price Index
- Land Information New Zealand

# What was used in order to build this?
